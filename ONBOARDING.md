### Welcome to OpenGov Africa – Team Onboarding Guide

*An Office of the Citizens, By the Citizens, and For the Citizens.*

Welcome to the movement. We're thrilled to have you. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.

#### **01. Why We’re Here**

We exist to build a more transparent, accountable, and participatory Africa—one open dataset, one civic tool, one community at a time.

> OpenGov Africa is where governance meets open-source, data meets people, and passion meets purpose.
---

#### **02. How We Work**

Our culture is collaborative, impact-driven, and unapologetically African. We operate on a few core beliefs:

* **Radical Transparency:** Data, processes, and decisions are open by default.
* **People Power:** Our communities are the agents of change. We build *with* them, not *for* them.
* **Shared Ownership:** Every contribution matters. Everyone has a voice.
* **Agility Over Bureaucracy:** We keep it lean, flexible, and fast to maximize our impact.
